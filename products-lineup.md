## üéØ Final Recommendations

### **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

1. **Verify Gelato Costs**
   - Log in, get exact pricing with your premium discount
   - Create pricing spreadsheet with actual numbers
   - Finalize retail prices

2. **Quality Test**
   - Order 1 acrylic + 1 framed print from Gelato
   - Print 2-3 posters in-house to verify quality
   - Make 1 test canvas to measure time/cost

3. **Competitive Shopping**
   - Order 1 product from Mapiful
   - Order 1 product from Grafomap
   - Compare quality, shipping, packaging

4. **Technical Planning**
   - Sketch out product selection UI
   - Map checkout flow
   - Choose payment processor (Stripe recommended)

### **Success Factors**

**Do This:**
- ‚úÖ Start with in-house posters + canvas (you already have capability)
- ‚úÖ Use Gelato for products you can't make yet (framed, acrylic, metal)
- ‚úÖ Price competitively to gain market share initially
- ‚úÖ Collect customer feedback religiously
- ‚úÖ Track metrics obsessively (conversion, AOV, margins)
- ‚úÖ Focus on your USPs (35+ themes, instant preview, unique frames)
- ‚úÖ Build email list for marketing and retention

**Avoid This:**
- ‚ùå Don't offer too many sizes initially (stick to 3-4 per product)
- ‚ùå Don't compete on price alone (emphasize features)
- ‚ùå Don't skip quality control (reputation is everything)
- ‚ùå Don't invest in UV printer until you're doing 100+ orders/month
- ‚ùå Don't neglect customer service (respond within 24 hours)
- ‚ùå Don't forget to photograph your best work (marketing gold)

### **Risk Mitigation**

**Inventory Risk:** ‚úÖ Minimal - POD model + in-house on-demand
**Capital Risk:** ‚úÖ Low - $500-1,500 to start
**Demand Risk:** üü° Medium - Test with soft launch first
**Quality Risk:** üü° Medium - QC checklist + Gelato reliability
**Competition Risk:** üü° Medium - Your features are differentiator
**Scaling Risk:** üü° Medium - Plan for assistant at 100+ orders/mo
